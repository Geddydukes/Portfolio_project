          <h3>Outdoor Interests</h3>
          <p>
            Outside of software engineering I love to spend my days outside in
            nature hiking, walking the beach, volunteering my time or playing
            basketball. With a passion for nature and a desire to do my part in
            maintaining it for the next generations I love any excuse I can get
            to get outside.

            strategies to sports management strategies and movie production.
